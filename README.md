Event logs, structured datasets recording the chronological sequence of activities and
events within a recruitment process, offer a valuable lens for understanding its intri-
cacies . Generated by information systems like recruitment software and applicant
tracking systems, these logs capture every applicant interaction, interview stage, and
hiring decision, unveiling a rich tapestry of candidate journeys and process dynam-
ics. Unlike traditional static surveys or self-reported data, event logs offer objective,
unbiased insights into the actual flow of the recruitment process, free from human
memory limitations or potential biases. This granular data allows researchers
and practitioners to delve deeper than ever before, uncovering hidden patterns, inef-
ficiencies, and areas for improvement in the quest for attracting and retaining top
talent.
